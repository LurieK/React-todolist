# Daily To-Dos

This web application maintains multiple to-do lists in one place. Using **React**, I've utilized useState and useEffect hooks to manage the state of each list individually and store items in localStorage. Additionally, with a focus on user experience, the application has a **responsive design**, making it easy to open on any device. 

<div align="center">
  <img src="todo_laptop.png" alt="Example Image" width="300" style="display:inline; margin-right:10px;"/>
  <img src="todo_mobile.png" alt="Example Image" width="300" style="display:inline;"/>
</div>

## Usage
- Creating a Task: To create a new task, enter a title in the input field at the top of the list and press Enter or hit Enter on your keyboard. 

- Marking a Task as Complete: Click on the checkbox next to a task to mark it as complete. Completed tasks will appear crossed out.

- Deleting Tasks: To delete tasks, click on the clear button bellow the item list.

- Local Storage: Task data is automatically saved to the local storage of your browser, allowing you to access your tasks even after closing and reopening the application.
